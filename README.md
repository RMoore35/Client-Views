# Client-Views
A study of views of restaurants on several platforms using SQL, PowerBI, and excel.

*****Update 12/20/2020: I am working on at least one more PowerBI screenshot and hope to have it uploaded shortly.

The SQL script for this project uses both joins and several advanced sub-queries. I have also provided a screenshot of the ERD
diagram created within Microsoft SSMS. I also included one screenshot of a PowerBI graph of the number of views received on any given
platform vs. the hour of the day in which the view occured. 

The data for this project was provided by a professor of mine at Tulane University. However, the client that provided that data to him asked
that it not be shared. I went through and used a few different techniques to alter the data while also trying to maintain the 
spirit of the project. I would be happy to discuss how I cleaned the data in more detail if necessary.

*****NOTHING IN THIS REPO IS INTENDED TO INFLUENCE ANY OPINIONS OR PUBLIC POLICY. THIS IS A PORTFOLIO PROJECT INTENDED TO SHOWCASE SKILLS AND ABILITIES.
