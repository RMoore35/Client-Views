# Client-Views
A study of views of restaurants on several platforms using SQL, PowerBI, and excel.

*****Update 12/20/2020: I am working on at least one more PowerBI screenshot and hope to have it uploaded shortly.

The SQL script for this project uses both joins and several advanced sub-queries. I have also provided a screenshot of the ERD
diagram created within Microsoft SSMS. I also included one screenshot of a PowerBI graph of the number of views received on any given
platform vs. the hour of the day in which the view occured. 

The data for this project was provided by a professor of mine at Tulane University. However, the client that provided that data to him asked
that it not be shared. I went through and used a few different techniques to alter the data while also trying to maintain the 
spirit of the project. I would be happy to discuss how I cleaned the data in more detail if necessary. One thing I will note is that I included a simple
ruby script that I used to generate around 15,000 fake restaurant names. I didn't write to a csv directly from the ruby file as it was easy enough
to just copy and paste from the Terminal. I don't know if this was the easiest way to do this, but it was a simple intro to Ruby for me and I 
hope to use it more in the future.
